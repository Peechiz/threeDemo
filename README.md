# Playing with React Three Fiber

This is a simple project to play with [React Three Fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber) and [Drei](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei). Much of this was made following ["threejs journey"](https://threejs-journey.com/) by [Bruno Simon](https://github.com/brunosimon/)
